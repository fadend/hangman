Hangman game from The Gilbert Post.

This is based on the hangman game I wrote long ago for The Gilbert Post, an independent student newspaper I founded for my high school.

Thanks to OoCities.org, the game was preserved here: https://www.oocities.org/gilbertnews/arcade/hangman.html.

I'm checking the code in as is to start with but plan to play with it a bit.
